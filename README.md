# SupplyX

SupplyX is a decentralized application (dApp) that was developed during the Web3 Conf Goa Hack. It seamlessly integrates the workflow of manufacturers, retailers, and customers to ensure an efficient supply chain process on the blockchain. The application allows for the registration of manufacturers and retailers, facilitates the placement and updating of orders by customers, and handles requests from manufacturers to retailers for raw materials based on preorders and counts.

## Workflow

1. **Register**: Manufacturers and retailers must register on the platform.

2. **Customer Orders**: Customers place orders and can update the priority of the order at their discretion.

3. **Manufacturer-Retailer Interaction**: The manufacturer receives the order and forwards a request to the retailer for raw materials based on the preorder and count. The retailer then receives the order and ships the requested raw materials.

4. **Order Confirmation and Payment Resolution**: Once the retailer has dispatched the raw material, the manufacturer will be notified. Upon confirmation of receiving the order by the manufacturer, the payment between the two parties is settled. The status of the user order will then be updated on the customer's dashboard, reflecting the current state of their order.
